Short Project Description:
We plan to work on a machine learning prediction algorithm on patient hospitalization. This is based on the data and problem posed by the Heritage Provider Network Health Prize, a $3M challenge to help health care providers plan proactively before patient emergencies occur and to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations. A successful prediction algorithm can save upwards of $30B of unnecessary spending per year. Our data and project are from here:
